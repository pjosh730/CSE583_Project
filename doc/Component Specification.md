# Component Specification

## Software components

Use python to build machine learning models.
- The system will use Natural Language ToolKit and Scikit-Learn to preprocessing text data. Those two will help transfer the dataset into useable vectors.
- Use matplotlib and word cloud libraries to visualize text data. They can build plots with size of each words indicate their frequency and importance.
- Scikit-Learn will help us build the function for machine learning module. And the Keras library will allow us to run it in the neural network system.

## Interactions to accomplish use cases
The system will do a stock price prediction job；

The inputs will be the daily top 25 news headlines;
The outputs will be a visualization of stock price trend show whether its increasing or decreasing;

With those input, the system will start analysis and provide a prediction on the following day stock price with “0” or “1” to represent its trending. 

## Preliminary plan

1.	Data processing;
2.	Data Visualization;
3.	Module Training;
4.	Module Evaluation;
5.	Deliverable Python Module;

We will accomplish the rest 3 steps in the following three weeks.
